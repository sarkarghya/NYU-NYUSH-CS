Compilation rules in the Makefile:

# A few examples below
# make libstack: 	generates and registers the array-based stack library (lib/libstack.a) (Q2)
# make stacksize: 	recompiles the stack with a new value for STACK_SIZE as a compilation directive and runs the stack test (Q3)
# make newlibstack:	recompiles the stack, implemented as a double-linked list, then integrates it in an update of libstack.a (Q5)
# make Q5:		uses newlibstack to recompile the binary executable (bin/stack_test), then runs it (Q5)
# make libfifo: 	compiles a dynamic queue implemented as a double-linked list, then integrates it in a library (lib/libfifo.a) (Q6)
