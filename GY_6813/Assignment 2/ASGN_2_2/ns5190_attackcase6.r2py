'''
Verify use of default file as template:
Verifies that when a file is opened with the create parameter set to False,
the reference monitor uses the existing default file as a template.
It checks that the new file has the same content as the default file.
This directly tests the requirement that the monitor must create a new file based
on the default file when the specified conditions are met.

if "default" in listfiles():
    removefile("default")
if "test_template.txt" in listfiles():
    removefile("test_template.txt")

# Create a default file
default = openfile("default", True)
default.writeat("TEMPLATE CONTENT", 0)
default.close()

# Open a file that does not exist using default as a template
try:
    myfile = openfile("test_template.txt", False)
    assert myfile.readat(None, 0) == "TEMPLATE CONTENT"  # Should read from the default file
except Exception as e:
    log("Error occurred: " + str(e))
