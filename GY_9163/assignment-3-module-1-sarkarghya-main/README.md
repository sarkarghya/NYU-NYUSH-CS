# Homework 3: Deployment Gone Wrong
## Module 1: Setup

### Introduction

Right when you thought things couldn't get worse, your company decided to re-hire Shoddycorp's Cut-Rate Contracting again. They say that you've done a fantastic job cleaning up their code, and that they're sure you can handle whatever problems may occur in the next project. It seems they will never learn...

Now that the web application is fixed and ready, your company wants it deployed in a scalable, reliable, and secure manner. To do this, Shoddycorp's Cut-Rate Contracting containerized your application, then claim they deployed it in a way that ensures availability and security. What they delivered, as usual, falls quite short of the mark.

Like last time, what Shoddycorp's Cut-Rate Contracting provided was a deployment that almost works. In fact, most would say it did work. Luckily you're applying an Application Security mindset. Shoddycorp containerized the application, the database, and a Nginx reverse proxy all in Docker. They then created Kubernetes yaml files to run these containers in a Kubernetes cluster, and configured them to talk to each other as needed. They even began adding some event monitoring for a monitoring software called Prometheus, though they didn't finish it.

However, upon further inspection, we can see that they didn't quite do things right. They left secrets lying around out in the open, they only create one replica of each pod, and there are passwords getting logged all over the place. All-in-all, it's a mess.

It looks like the job to fix this falls to you again. Luckily, Kevin Gallagher (KG) has read through the files already and pointed out some of the things that are going wrong, and provided a list of things for you to fix. Before you can work on that, though, let's get your environment set up.

Just a disclaimer, in case it needs to be said again: Like with all Shoddycorp's Cut-Rate Contracting deliverables, this is not code you would like to mimic in any way. Their comments are sparse, and some things may raise an eyebrow or two!

### Frequently Asked Questions

Kubernetes is a fairly [complicated beast](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/). To help you get oriented, we've created a [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) document that should help with common questions. As always, please make use of office hours and ask questions on Ed Discussion, and get started early. This Module should be quick, but only if you take the time to read through the manuals, and understand your local setup. 

### Step 1: Setting up Your Environment

To complete this assignment, you will need Docker, minikube, and kubectl.
Installation is not simple, and is highly platform-dependent.
We recommend you look at the setup script we created and is included in this repository, named 'setup.sh'. 

Every operating system environment is different, we recommend you try and perform the assignment work within a Linux distribution, preferable Ubuntu. Remember all that work you did setting up Docker in the previous two Assignments while ensuring your GIT account keys are paired and working? Well today is the day it's going to pay off!

Rather than detail how to install this software on different platforms, below are links to relevant information on how to install these tools (if you chose not to use the scripts)
at their official sites, as well as how to operate them. 

To install Docker, please see the following Website and select [Docker Desktop.](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

To install Kubectl, please see the following [Website.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

To install Minikube, please see the following [Website.](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

As in the previous assignments, we will be using Git and GitHub for submission,
so please ensure you still have Git installed (Verified Commits). Remember to continue to follow git
best practices, including in your commit messages!

#### Image Versions - something to keep an eye out for

You may see something similar to the below:
```
üÜï  Kubernetes 1.32.0 is now available. If you would like to upgrade, specify: --kubernetes-version=v1.32.0
‚ú®  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
üëç  Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
üöú  Pulling base image v0.0.46 ...
üîÑ  Restarting existing docker container for "minikube" ...
‚ùó  Image was not built for the current minikube version. To resolve this you can delete and recreate your minikube cluster using the latest images. Expected minikube version: v1.34.0 -> Actual minikube version: v1.35.0
```

Version mismatches like this are common! The ‚ùó symbol indicates a version mismatch warning‚Äîin this case, the image was built for Minikube v1.34.0, but you're running Minikube v1.35.0 (in this example). This can lead to compatibility issues. Such mismatches often occur when teams upgrade to newer versions without properly managing dependencies. The fix? You may need to delete and recreate the Minikube cluster to align versions - if the versions can even align, either way, worthy of a discussion in your writeups in the future modules of this assignment. Looks like Shoddy Corp didn‚Äôt handle their update policies very well!

### Step 1.1: Rundown of Files

This repository has a lot of files. The following are files you will likely be
modifying throughout this assignment.

* GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py
* GiftcardSite/LegacySite/views.py
* GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
* db/Dockerfile
* db/k8/db-deployment.yaml

In addition, you may need to make new files in order to work with Prometheus (later Module).

### Step 1.2.a: Getting it to Work 

Once you have installed the necessary software, you are ready to run the whole thing
using minikube. First, start minikube.

```bash
minikube start
```

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues such as "Unable to pick a default driver" or if Docker is not healthy, read the error messages carefully - most error messages in software truly do give you hints on where to look and how to diagnose further, especially in well supported software!
 
 To verify that Docker is running correctly, this command is very useful:
 
 ```bash
 docker info
 ```
 
 If you have a permission issue you may need add your user to the Docker group:

 ```bash
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
 newgrp docker
 ```

Insight: '-a' stands for "append" and adds the user to the specified group without removing them from other groups they might already belong to. 'G' specifies the group that you want to add the user to. '$USER' is an environment variable that automatically holds the name of the currently logged-in user. You should know all about environment variables from Assignment 2. 
 
It is good practice to check 'docker info' to see if there are still issues after the above permissioning. If not, try 'minikube start' again.
 
If you still have issues still you may need to explicitly set Minikube to use the Docker driver (virtualbox for example is 'minikube config set driver virtualbox'):

```bash
minikube config set driver docker
```

Remember, hints are there for a reason! ```bash‚ùó  These changes will take effect upon a minikube delete and then a minikube start```.
 
Finally, you might also need to run the following command to configure your shell to use Docker with Minikube:
 
 ```bash
 eval $(minikube docker-env)
 ```

This does not mean you 'have' to implement all of these commands, these are situations you 'may' face. Look up what a command means so understand it's purpose. As always, we really want to drive you towards being able to look up information in a targetted fashion. 

### Step 1.2.b: Getting Our Setup to Work 

Next, we need to build the Dockerfiles that Kubernetes will use to create the
cluster. This can be done using the following lines, assuming you are in the
root directory of the repository. These take time to build, be patient.

```
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3:v0 .
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3-proxy:v0 proxy/
docker build -t nyuappsec/assign3-db:v0 db/
```

Then use kubectl to create the pods and services needed for our project. Again,
these commands assume you are in the root directory of the repository.

```
kubectl apply -f db/k8
kubectl apply -f GiftcardSite/k8
kubectl apply -f proxy/k8
```
Verify that the pods and services were created correctly.

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get service
```

There should be three pod entries:

* One that starts with assignment3-django-deploy
* One that starts with mysql-container
* One that starts with proxy

They should each have status RUNNING after approximately a minute, this depends on the resources your local machine has available.

There should also be four service entries:

* One called kubernetes
* One called assignment3-django-service
* One called mysql-service
* One called proxy-service

To see if you can connect to the site, run the following command:

```
minikube service proxy-service
```

This should open your browser to the deployed site. You should be able to view the first page of the site and navigate around. If this worked, you are ready to move on to the next part. If you are using WSL (Windows) or another virtual machine without graphical user interface, keep in mind how your localhost loopback works for access in your native environment (or research it). 


### Step 1.3: Git Signature and Pushing to DockerHub

**What is DockerHub?**
DockerHub is a cloud-based container registry that allows developers to store, manage, and distribute Docker container images. It serves as a centralized repository where teams can collaborate, share, and deploy containerized applications efficiently. If only ShoddyCorp was so wise...

There are some other useful benefits to DockerHub and similar platforms:
* Verified and Trusted Images: DockerHub provides official and verified images, reducing the risk of malicious software entering the development pipeline.
* Access Controls: With private repositories, teams can restrict access to sensitive images, ensuring only authorized users can pull or push images.
* Automated Scanning: DockerHub integrates with security tools to scan images for vulnerabilities, helping developers identify and mitigate risks early.
* Immutable Images: Once an image is published, it cannot be altered, ensuring consistency and integrity across deployments.

Just like GitHub, DockerHub provides some useful CI/CD benefits as well:

* Seamless Integration with GitHub Actions: DockerHub works well with GitHub Actions, automating the process of building, testing, and deploying container images. These types of platforms tend to integrate with quite a few 3rd parties. Do think about this though, if all the larger platforms development seamless integrations with each other, how easy is it for a new provider to join the mix?
* Efficient Deployment: Instead of rebuilding applications from scratch, Docker images allow for faster and more predictable deployments.
* Versioning and Tagging: Using tags, teams can version control their images, making it easier to roll back or deploy specific versions of applications.
* Scalability: DockerHub enables teams to distribute container images across multiple environments, ensuring consistency from development to production.

This should all be giving you some real GIT d√©j√† vu...

**TO DOs:**

Please complete the following:

* As always, your commits need to be signed
* Use GitHub Actions to automate deploying your Django container to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
* Create an account on DockerHub, if you haven't already. Ideally, you would store your login values in GitHub secrets. You really should use a DockerHub Access Token! For local testing, it's okay just use environment variables, but assume this account can be compromised, do not put anything sensitive on your DockerHub or GitHub! Don't forget the git ignore, and be **very mindful** of what you push to DockerHub!
* This is a decent'ish template to follow [GitHub Action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) on how to set up an action to push an image to DockerHub. It is not perfect, and will require tweaking/modifiations. Push your Django Docker Image to a DockerHub repository.

As always, limit access with Least Privilege. Grant only necessary permissions to users (you are a user btw, probably needs quite a few permissions) and services interacting with DockerHub - do all sevices push and pull?

### Ready for Grading

This module is straightforward ‚Äî follow the steps carefully and keep the SECRET_KEY secure as well as any DockerHub login credentials, and you'll earn full credit.

Avoid breaking Docker, Kubernetes, or Django files, as errors will be flagged by the autograder. The module is designed to pass Gradescope as-is. Just set it up, then configure Secrets and GitHub Actions to deploy to DockerHub.

Feel free to start submitting on gradescope to see how you would score. Once you want to lock in your grade push the `assign3mod1handin` tag with the following:

To submit this part, push the `assign3mod1handin` tag with the following:
```commandline
git tag -a -m "Completed assign3 module1." assign3mod1handin
git push origin main
git push origin assign3mod1handin
```
**DO NOT PUSH THIS TAG UNTIL YOU WANT TO BE GRADED**

**The autograder may take some time to process this assignment, as it rebuilds your Docker image and verifies the entire Kubernetes setup. Please be patient and allow Gradescope to finish before resubmitting.**
